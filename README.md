# castles_and_transformers

Small mini projects created just for fun. Both were written in Java through Eclipse on a Macbook. 

**Assumptions Part 1: Castle Building** <br />
Assessment of land can be done by manually entering your integer array "map" in the console, or hard coding values into the main method.
* One castle is always built at the start of the array
* Castles are built only onk peaks or valleys
* Only one castle is built per peak or valley


**Assumptions Part 2: War on Cybertron** <br />
* A Transformer is created as a Class object and tech specs are created as the Transformer class variables
* A separate variable ("destroyed") is used to determine whether they have been destroyed

Transformers can be created manually in the console. Enter each bot with the format:

        Bumblebee A 2 8 4 7 7 10 1 7

For cases where names include two words, do no include spaces.<br />
Hit enter afte each bot has been entered. <br />
Use "x" when done entering tranformers into the battle.<br />

In the *main* function, use ***createTransformersManual()*** instead of ***createTransformers()***.

Hard-coded Tranformer objects may also be used. Some have already been included under the function createTransformers().
