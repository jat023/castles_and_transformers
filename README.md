# castles_and_transformers

Small mini projects created just for fun. Both were written in Java through Eclipse on a Macbook. 

**Part 1: Castle Building** <br /><br />
**Assumptions**<br />
* One castle is always built at the start of the array
* Castles are built only onk peaks or valleys
* Only one castle is built per peak or valley

**Instructions**<br />
Land assessment can be done by manually entering your integer array "map" in the console, or using hard coded values (an integer array) in the main method.



**Part 2: War on Cybertron** <br />
**Assumptions**<br />
* A Transformer is created as a Class object and their tech specs are created as the Transformer class variables
* A separate variable ("destroyed") is used to determine whether a Transformer has been destroyed

**Instructions**<br />
Transformers can be entered manually in the console or hard-coded. For manual console entry, enter each bot on a separate line with the format:

        Bumblebee A 2 8 4 7 7 10 1 7

For cases where names include two words, do no include spaces.<br />
Type "x" and then hit Enter when done entering Tranformers for battle.<br />

In the *main* function, use **createTransformersManual()** when using the console.

If using hard-coded Tranformer objects, comment out **createTransformersManual()** and uncomment **createTransformers()** function in main. Some Transformer objects have already been included.
